# Fading-BG-PagingView-Swift
A scrollView whose background changes between various colors (can use images too) as you scroll with a fading effect.

# Features
1. Horizontal paging scrollview
2. Fades the background from one color to another based on the users inputs
3. User can scroll slowly and the fade animation happens based on the amount of scroll made

# Inspiration: 
I took inspiration from the famous app Abstruct on the App Store to replicate and build this. I liked how the gradient background fades as the user switches between different Categories.
